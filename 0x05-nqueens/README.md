0x05. N Queens
Algorithm
Python

Steps to Implement the Solution:
Handle Command-Line Arguments:

Ensure the correct number of arguments is provided.
Validate that the argument is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
Backtracking Algorithm:

Create a recursive function to place queens.
Use a list to track the positions of queens.
Check if placing a queen in a position is valid.
If placing the queen leads to a solution, add the solution to the result list.
If not, backtrack and try the next position.
Print the Solutions:

Format the output as required.

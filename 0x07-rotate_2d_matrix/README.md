0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
Algorithm
Python

Steps to Rotate the Matrix
Transpose the Matrix:

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping rows with columns. For a matrix matrix, this means changing matrix[i][j] to matrix[j][i].
Reverse Each Row:

After transposing, reverse each row of the matrix to achieve the 90-degree rotation.
